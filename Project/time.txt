Before properly clearing memory Memcopy variant runs out of memory and gets killed. Approached 8g or ram
zsh: killed     ./sudoku_memcopy 4 input/input_4_2.txt out.txt

After properly freeing memory for Memcopy. 6.3 times slower than serial version
./sudoku_memcopy 4 input/input_4_2.txt out.txt  168.70s user 0.41s system 99% cpu 2:49.46 total
